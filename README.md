# Cisc372Project

## This Repo was made to parallelize C and Python code to compute Pi with the Monte Carlo Simulation 

*OpenMP and OpenACC code in MonteCarlo Folder*

**To compile OpenMP code:**

make OPM

**To run OpenMP code:**

make run


**To compile OpenACC code:**

make ACC

**To run OpenACC code:**

make ACC

This code was designed to run on CISC372 VM 


pgc++ 19.4.0 compiler for OpenACC

gcc 7.4.0 compiler for OpenMP

*Python Cuda code is in the CudaNumbaPython folder*
